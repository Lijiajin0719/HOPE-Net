# HOPE-Net
HOPE-Net is a Mamba-Guided Hybrid Omni-Perceptual Enhanced Network for efficient and accurate sperm detection in clinical intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) procedures. Designed to overcome the limitations of manual assessment and existing deep learning approaches, HOPE-Net integrates state space models with convolutional operations to achieve global feature modeling with linear computational complexity, enabling real-time performance in complex clinical environments.
